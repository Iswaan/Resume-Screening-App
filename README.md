# Resume-Screening-App
🧠This project is an AI-powered resume screening tool designed to automate and streamline the recruitment process. It performs two core functions:

Resume Categorization – Classifies resumes into predefined job categories using a trained Random Forest classifier and TF-IDF vectorization.

Job Recommendation – Suggests suitable job roles to candidates based on the skills and content in their resumes.

Key Features:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for resume text preprocessing.

Machine learning models (Random Forest) for accurate classification and recommendation.

TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.

Dual-model architecture: one for categorization and one for recommendation.

Visual analysis and insights to support HR decision-making.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, Pickle, Matplotlib, NLP (TF-IDF)
