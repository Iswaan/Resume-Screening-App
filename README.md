# Resume-Screening-App
ðŸ§ This project is an AI-powered resume screening tool designed to automate and streamline the recruitment process. It performs two core functions:

1. Resume Categorization â€“ Classifies resumes into predefined job categories using a trained Random Forest classifier and TF-IDF vectorization.

2. Job Recommendation â€“ Suggests suitable job roles to candidates based on the skills and content in their resumes.

Key Features:

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for resume text preprocessing.

2. Machine learning models (Random Forest) for accurate classification and recommendation.

3. TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.

4. Dual-model architecture: one for categorization and one for recommendation.

5. Visual analysis and insights to support HR decision-making.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, Pickle, Matplotlib, NLP (TF-IDF)
